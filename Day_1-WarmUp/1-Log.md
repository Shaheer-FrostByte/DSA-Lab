# Day 1

## What I Practiced
- Arrays (vector indexing)
- Loops
- Prefix sum idea

## LeetCode Problems Solved
- Running Sum of 1D Array 
- Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits 

### Running Sum of 1D Array
1st I used a simple brute force (nested loop) approach. It worked.
Then I improved it to a prefix-sum approach. It was better.

### Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits 
Used a for-each loop to iterate through the given array. 
Used a do-while loop to count number of digits.
Checked if the count was even. If so, update the result(number of even numbers in array) by 1.

## Day Summary
1st day of learning DSA. It feels good to start C++ again. I hope this semester goes well, Insha Allah. I'm trying to practice a bit before the semester starts, so I have an easier time during the semester.
